Mass and Moment of Inertia\n\nIn this first exercise we are going to fit the mass and moment of inertia of the Earth for a two-layer case (i.e. with one value for the density of the core and one for the density of the mantle). In the code below a start is given for two functions that calculate the mass and moment of inertia for this simple Earth, but the equations themselves still need to be implemented.  \n\nThe mass is given by:\n$ M = \\frac{4}{3} \\pi [R^3 \\rho_{m} +  r_{c}^3 (\\rho_{c}-\\rho_{m})] $\n\nThe Moment of Intertia is given by: \n$I  = \\frac{8}{15} \\pi [(R^5\\rho_{m} + r_{c}^5 (\\rho_{c}-\\rho_{m})] $\n\nWhere $R$ is the radius of the Earth (6371 km), $r_c$ is the radius of the core (3481 km), $\\rho_c$ is the density of the core, and $\\rho_m$ is the density of the mantle. \n\n*a.* Show the above equation for the mass results from $ M = \\int \\rho dV $ when assuming a two-layered sphere with constant densities. \n\n*Bonus take-home question: Derive the equation for the Moment of Inertia of a two-layered sphere.*\n\n*b.* Add the equations to the two functions started below. If you have done this correctly the error messages will dissapear. \n\nNote:\n- The numpy library offers the value of pi - use np.pi (remember to import the libraries at the top!)\n- To take a power of a number in python you use **, e.g. $x^y = x**y$\n- Python cares about indentation. The equation within the function needs to be indented. \n\n\n"
